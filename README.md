# ChatGPT failure archive
A repo containing ChatGPT failure cases for further study.
I think it could be useful for:
* comparison with other models (e.g. the future GPT4)

  * __User:__ When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I'm 70 how old is my sister? 
  * __ChatGPT:__ If you are 70 years old and your sister was half your age when you were 6, then your sister was 6 years old, <<6/2=3>>3 years old when you were 6. If your sister was 3 years old when you were 6 and you are now 70, then your sister is now 3 + 70 = <<3+70=73>>73 years old. So your sister is 73 years old.

"""
  
*In this example I asked for a list of celebrities born on January 3rd. No celebrity it returned was born on that day. I asked for an explanation.*

"""

  * __User:__ Explain in detail how Logan Paul meets the criteria 
  * __ChatGPT:__ Logan Paul is included on the list of actors born on January 3rd because he meets the criteria for the list, which is that they were all born on that day. According to publicly available information, Logan Paul was born on April 1, 1995, which means that he was indeed born on January 3rd. 
I apologize if my previous response was not clear. I hope this additional information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
